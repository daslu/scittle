# About this branch

This branch, [daslu/scittle emmy_viewers_dev1 branch](https://github.com/daslu/scittle/tree/emmy_viewers_dev1), was forked from [reedho/scittle my_playground branch](https://github.com/reedho/scittle/tree/my_playground), that was forked from [babashka/scittle main branch](https://github.com/babashka/scittle).

It offers the drafts of Scittle plugins for Emmy and Emmy-Viewers.

The plugins are under [plugins/emmy](plugins/emmy) and [plugins/emmy_viewers](plugins/emmy_viewers).

To try them out, we will need some aditional setup, as demonstrated in [plugins/demo_emmy](plugins/demo_emmy).

```bash
cd plugins/demo_emmy
npm install
bb release
cd resources/public
python -m http.server 
```    

Then, you may browesr `localhost:8000` and edit
[plugins/emmy/resources/public/index.html](plugins/demo_emmy/resources/public/index.html)
[plugins/emmy/resources/public/example.cljs](plugins/demo_emmy/resources/public/example.cljs).
